NICE TO HAVE

	Restore button does not restore sort number.
		Not easy, file is moved immediately on change (focus out).
		There might be a problem if the widget can change without focus?

DONE

	Should default and be able to show latest entries
	'comments' in about not used... delete.
	Code review/reduction... hooks over done?
	bug with bold dates sometimes...
	Put a configurable limit to the number of results.
	Verify that starts out on lock mode when so configured
	Keyword search included tags
		Have searches combine with eachother.
	Add a restore option... the *.bak file.
	This diary need to have the left panel be a little wider.
	Window starts out to small.
	Make the search start at "Search All Time", but
	then have it remember where it was last set to.
	Diary is fast enough that "Dock" is not needed.
